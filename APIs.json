On Ultramarine, guests benefit from two twin-engine helicopters that will provide spectacular aerial views of the Arctic landscape, the most extensive portfolio of adventure options in the industry, more outdoor wildlife viewing spaces than any other expedition ship its size, and 20 quick-launching Zodiacs to get you closer to ancient glaciers, dramatic fjords and towering icebergs.

Keep your eyes peeled for the elusive and majestic creatures that make their home in this wilderness, such as whales, walrus, muskoxen and polar bears.

    "description": "This brand new itinerary celebrates the life of Sir Ernest Shackleton, whose passing in South Georgia on January 5, 1922, marked the end of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The 20-day itinerary Celebrating Shackleton: Journey from Antarctica to South Georgia (which will coincide with the centenary of Shackleton\u2019s death) not only honors one of Antarctica\u2019s greatest heroes\u2014but also his unwavering spirit of exploration, which Quark Expeditions continues to emulate to this day. Whereas Shackleton and his crew braved the harsh elements of Antarctica aboard Endurance, which had the most basic of amenities, guests on this voyage will board the brand new ship Ultramarine\u2014during its inaugural Antarctic sailing season. The technologically-advanced vessel will follow the route of Shackleton\u2019s Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914\u20131917), allowing passengers to experience the full splendor of Antarctica and South Georgia while exploring on Ultramarine\u2019s two twin-engine helicopters and 20 fast-launching Zodiacs. Guests will cross the Drake Passage to the Antarctic Peninsula, visit the Weddell Sea (where the ill-fated Endurance met its tragic end), then onto Elephant Island and, ultimately, wildlife-rich South Georgia, where, if conditions allow, guests will pay homage to Shackleton at his grave at Grytviken. Throughout the voyage, passengers will enjoy special presentations by polar experts Tim Jarvis (author of \u201cChasing Shackleton\u201d) and Dr. Ross MacPhee, curator of the ground-breaking museum exhibit \u201cThe Endurance: Shackleton\u2019s Legendary Antarctic Expedition.\u201d",
